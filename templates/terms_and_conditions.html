            <strong><u> Introduction:</u></strong>
            We are a team of six students in the CS3028: Software Engineering and Professional Practice course at the University of Aberdeen. For our coursework, we are conducting a research project aimed at understanding how people collaborate and communicate using an instant-message-based map navigation task with multiple speakers and versions of the map. This study will involve participants discussing and navigating the maps through a chat interface while referring to the visual elements on the maps. The study will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. <br><br>
            
            <strong><u>Description of the Study:</u></strong>
            In this study, you will be asked to participate in a real-time interaction with another participant using an online interface. You will be assigned one of two roles randomly: instruction giver or instruction follower. The instruction giver will guide the instruction follower through a map using referring expressions, and the instruction follower will navigate the map based on the instructions provided. The map will contain landmarks that are not explicitly named, necessitating the use of grounded referring expressions. The objective is to collaborate with other participants to achieve a shared goal. The progress and maps of both participants are not visible to each other, only the dialogue component is shared between them.<br><br>
            
            <strong><u>Potential Dangers or Discomfort:</u></strong>
            While we do not anticipate any significant dangers or discomfort for participants in this study, it is possible that some participants may experience negative emotions or distress due to the interaction or task-related challenges. Participants are expected to maintain a respectful and polite attitude throughout the interaction. Any form of offensive language, personal attacks, or bullying behaviour will not be tolerated. If you experience any discomfort, you have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any consequences. Additionally, participants are advised not to share any personal information or anything else they do not want to disclose in the chat.  <br><br>
            
            <strong><u>Rights and Compensation:</u></strong>
            You have the right to withdraw from the study at any point, and you can choose to skip any tasks that you do not feel comfortable with. Participation in this study is voluntary. There will be no compensation for participating in this study, but your contribution will help advance our understanding of human interaction and collaborative problem-solving. <br><br>
            
            <strong><u>Data collection:</u></strong>
            We will collect the following data during the study:
            <li>	Your chat typed messages and timestamps. </li>
            <li>	Your interactions with the map (e.g., drawing lines)</li>
            This data will be stored securely, and any personally identifiable information is not collected in the first place. The collected data will be used for research purposes only, to help us better understand collaborative problem-solving and communication strategies, and they will not be retained beyond the necessary amount for conducting the experiment. <br><br>
            
            <strong><u>Consent:</u></strong>
            By clicking "Yes" below, you confirm that you have read and understood the information provided above, and you agree to participate in this study. You also agree that the researchers can use your anonymized data for research purposes. <br>
            
            <br>If you have any questions or concerns about the study, please contact the students, at u16ak20@abdn.ac.uk. <br>
