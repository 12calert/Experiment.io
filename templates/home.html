      Two players are paired together with identical maps while one playerâ€™s acts as the instruction giver and is given map has a randomly path 
      on it and the other player's does not. From there the first player must communicate to the other player the path that 
      they can see. The second player must try to draw the map on the map provided to them. Once the player's both decided they are finished they choose to complete
      the game, the map with the correct path is shown along with the map that the instruction taker drew. Conversely one of the two players may give up, in which case the
      the map from both players are shown also.</p>
